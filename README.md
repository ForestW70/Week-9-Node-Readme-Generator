### About This Project

* # Project description:
  This node application uses the inquirer package to prompt the user with a few questions in the terminal, and then uses those input values to generate a professional readme markdown file for any of your new projects. You may input a handfull of useful things such as desired licence,  project info, and contact info.

* # Usage instructions
  This application is meant to create a quick, professional read me file for your new projects.

* # Project installation
  On first launch, use "npm i" in your integrated terminal to install all of the dependencies from the package. Then, type "npm start" to begin the application. Follow the prompts and it will generate a markdown file for you.
     
* # Additional comments
  It was tedious to test this app and to find resources like a full list of licenses to use, but I thought that the examples of code already in the project were good places to start and helped me figure out how to go about certain parts of it. I wasnt sure what we were supposed to put in the "tests" segment. I also would have liked to figure out how to create different paths of questions based on the response from another question, but I didn't have time to figure this out.
