  - It was tedious to test this app and to find resources like a full list of licenses to use, but I thought that the examples of code already in the project were good places to start and helped me figure out how to go about certain parts of it. I wasnt sure what we were supposed to put in the "tests" segment. I also would have liked to figure out how to create different paths of questions based on the response from another question, but I didn't have time to figure this out.
