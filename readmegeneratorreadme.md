# Project description
* This node application uses the inquirer package to prompt the user with a few questions in the terminal, and then uses those input values to generate a professional readme markdown file for any of your new projects. You may input a handfull of useful things such as desired licence,  project info, and contact info.

* to create a professional readme file for your projects.

# Additional comments
* It took me a while to fully understand what was desired from a full professional readme. In the future, you may want to suppliment this project with a link that displays the licences usually used. I found a good resource that helped me create the licence object. I also thought the examples you started the project out with (especially in the generatemarkdown.js) we're very good at leading me in the right direction.

# Project installation
* "npm start" in your integrated terminal, then answer the prompts.
